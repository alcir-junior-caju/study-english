# Indefinite Articles

## Use And Structure

Indefinite Articles > A/An < Only with singular nouns > Nick is **a** doctor. (Nick is **one** person.) | Sara is **an** English teacher. (Sarah is **one** person.)

> An apple, an orange, and a banana, please.

### The client wants:
- **an apple (= one apple)**
- **an orange (= one orange)**
- **a banana (= one banana)**

**Is it a specific apple, a specific banana?**
*No. It refers to an unspecified fruit from the lot.*

Indefinite Articles > A (**Before consonant sounds**) | An (**Before vowel sounds**)

Mike has **a c**ar. (**C** = consonant sond)

Laura is **an o**rganized student. (**O** = vowel sound)

- In English some letters may sound like a consonant or like a vowel in different words.

| Letter H | Letter U |
| ---------| ---------|
|**Honest** He is **an** honest man. (The **H** is not pronounced, so it starts with a vowel sound.)|**Umbrela** Carol has **an** umbrella. (The **U** is pronounced as a vowel.)|
|**Hotel** The Atlas is **a** hotel in Milan. (The **H** is pronounced, so it starts with a consonant sound.)|**Uniform** I use **a** uniform at work. (The **U** is pronounced as a /y/ like in the word "you," so it starts with a consonant sound.)|

### Important:
> Nick and Sarah are **students**. Plural, so **no** indefinite article is used.

## Examples in Context
#### Rainy Day
> **Kate** - Oh my God, it's raining!
>
> **Stu** - Do you have **an umbrella** with you?
>
> **Kate** - No.
>
>**Stu** - Come with me then.

#### At work
> **Paul** - Michael, what time is the meeting?
>
> **Michael** - It's starts in **an hour**.
>
> **Paul** - Oh, Ok! Thanks.
