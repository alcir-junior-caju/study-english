| Tony is a **~~man weird~~**. | Tony is **a weird man**. |

# Indefinite Articles

## Use And Structure

Indefinite Articles > A/An < Only with singular nouns > Nick is **a** doctor. (Nick is **one** person.) | Sara is **an** English teacher. (Sarah is **one** person.)

> An apple, an orange, and a banana, please.

### The client wants:

- **an apple (= one apple)**
- **an orange (= one orange)**
- **a banana (= one banana)**

**Is it a specific apple, a specific banana?**
_No. It refers to an unspecified fruit from the lot._

Indefinite Articles > A (**Before consonant sounds**) | An (**Before vowel sounds**)

Mike has **a c**ar. (**C** = consonant sond)

Laura is **an o**rganized student. (**O** = vowel sound)

- In English some letters may sound like a consonant or like a vowel in different words.

| Letter H                                                                                                     | Letter U                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Honest** He is **an** honest man. (The **H** is not pronounced, so it starts with a vowel sound.)          | **Umbrela** Carol has **an** umbrella. (The **U** is pronounced as a vowel.)                                                             |
| **Hotel** The Atlas is **a** hotel in Milan. (The **H** is pronounced, so it starts with a consonant sound.) | **Uniform** I use **a** uniform at work. (The **U** is pronounced as a /y/ like in the word "you," so it starts with a consonant sound.) |

### Important:

> Nick and Sarah are **students**. Plural, so **no** indefinite article is used.

## Examples in Context

#### Rainy Day

> **Kate** - Oh my God, it's raining!
>
> **Stu** - Do you have **an umbrella** with you?
>
> **Kate** - No.
>
> **Stu** - Come with me then.

#### At work

>
> **Michael** - It's starts in **an hour**.
>
> **Paul** - Oh, Ok! Thanks.
