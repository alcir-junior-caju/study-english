# Articles: Definite, Indefinite and Zero

## Use And Structure

Let's start by reviewing the **definite** and **indefinite articles**.
| | **Indefinite Article A** | **Indefinite Article An** | **Indefinite Article An** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Singular | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Plural | No | No | Yes |
| Before vowel sounds | No | Yes | Yes |
| Before consoant sounds | Yes | No | Yes |
| Specific nouns | No | No | Yes |
| General nouns | Yes | Yes | No |

Remember that we don't usually use **the** before proper nouns. There are some exceptions.

- **~~The~~** Claudia is a nice girl.
- Carl loves the United States. **Ok!**

**Zero Article**

We don't use articles:

- **before general nouns in the plural and uncountable nouns**

  - Dogs are man's best friend. **_(dogs in general)_**
  - Oxygen is important for life. **_(oxygen = uncountable noun)_**
  - Diana teaches children. **_(children in general)_**
  - Tanya has homework to do. **_(homework = uncountable noun)_**

- **with nouns in unlimited numbers**

  - Everybody loves chocolate. **_(unlimited number / quantity of chocolate)_**
  - Mary plants flowers. **_(unlimited number of flowers)_**
  - Stewart collects books. **_(unlimited number of books)_**

- **before possessives**
  - This is my car. **_(no article before my)_**
  - Tommy's girlfriend is gorgeous. **_(no article before Tommy's)_**

Take a look at the difference between **definite**, **indefinite** and **zero article**.

- This is a group of **pens**. **Pens** are used for writing. **_(pens in general)_**
- This is **a** fountain pen. **_(It is one type of pen)_**
- **The** fountain pen is used in calligraphy. **_(this specific type of pen)_**
